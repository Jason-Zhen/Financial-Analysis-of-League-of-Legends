            <h2>Free to Play, Free to Win</h2>
            <p>League of Legends has a relatively low conversion of free-to-paying customers and when compared to other successful games on the market which are either pay to play or pay to win with many micro transactions, it is not intuitive as to how this game has accumulated the financial success it sees today. This does however provide the key to Riot Games’ success: their reach. Their far reach allows them to tap into a larger base of users making up for the payment model. This is not a criticism of the model Riot Games’ has created but rather an explanation of it and in fact, I would argue that the model and player orientated culture that Riot Games cultivates is the key to their financial success. Therefore, the question becomes, how has Riot Games created this reach?</p>

                <h3>Easy to Learn, Difficult to Master</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Simplicity gives Riot Games its edge over its competitors and has allowed it to most importantly, develop the reach it has today, which is necessary for its financial success. Simplicity or simplistic design in the context of video game design here means that the game is designed in such a way that it is easy to grasp or understand – even for new users. This is commonly done via simplistic UI, intuitive gameplay mechanics, and generally adhering to Bushnell’s Law, which is that the game should be easy to learn and difficult to master with particular importance towards ease of learning.</p>

        <h2>Power of Memes</h2>
        <p>Social media is a large part of today’s culture and memes are the language. Social media allows for companies to interact with their users and a well-run social media account will display good Public Relations skills putting the company in a position of favorable public opinion. Often times this is done to show that the company “cares” about the user and is willing to at least listen to their wants and demands. An approachable and in tune company is one that users are more likely to trust will produce content that is trustworthy and dependable in the future. Users are more likely to spend money on products created by a company that they trust rather than ones they do not. (wording)</p>
        <p>Electronic Arts (EA) vs Riot Games</p>
        <p>EA was voted the worst company on the advocacy website, Consumerist, in 2012 beating out Bank of America. And thus, their social media presence is mostly damage control</p>
        <q>Consumerist readers ultimately decided that the type of greed exhibited by EA, which is supposed to be making the world a more fun place, is worse than Bank of America's avarice, which some would argue is the entire point of operating a bank</q>
        <p>Memes: <q>Days since last Yorick skin</q>, <q>Sandbox mode</q>, <q>Replays</q>,</p>
        <p>Social Media Presence by Riot</p>
        <p>Riot employees commenting with official Riot tags on many posts. Culture itself is even shown as Rioters themselves are “meme’ing”.</p>
        <p>The social media presence by Riot gives them favorable public opinion</p>
        <p>In giving players what they actually want, Riot is showing that they are willing to listen, differentiating themselves from most other companies which opt not to have vocal social media presences as it could be damaging to their reputation.</p>

        <h2>Lore of Legends and the Ikea Effect</h2>
        <p>(League makes you care about their characters…emotional tie…Look at the amazing reveals and lore articles about new champions…Ornn, beautiful. People care more about something when they have some sort of tie to it, if they spent hours of their day maining one champion, they’ll develop a tie to that champion and be more likely to spend money on skins for that champion. (Why “Your Shop” works)</p>
        <p>The Ikea effect is a cognitive bias in which “consumers place a disproportionately high value on products that they have partially created” and in this same manner, League of Legends players who “main” a certain champion or champions will tend to place a higher value upon that specific champion when compared to other champions. They develop an emotional tie or at least care about the champion in some way.</p>
        <p>League of Legends has an extensive lore that is not unlike other games but once again, it does something to differentiate itself from other video games out there. They make the players care. One need look no further than the release of recent champions, Ornn, Xayah and Rakan. Beautiful websites with an exploreable design for were created to supplement the lore of the champions and to showcase their unique personalities and quirks which allow players to relate to them.  (Ornn, Xayah and Rakan website reveals) Additionally, music videos are created for certain skins and champions in a similarly way. (Example of the Star Guardians Music Video which legitimately makes the user FEEL sadness at Jinx leaving and HYPE at Jinx coming back to save the day)  (wording)</p>
        <p>In creating emotional ties for players to champions and skins, Riot Games creates products that have higher value to players. These are products that the player likes and wants, and therefore are more likely to purchase.  This is most prominently seen in the introduction of the “Your Shop” promotion that Riot Games runs every year but on a fundamental level, this idea of the Ikea effect and the emotional tie towards certain champions and skins is always present and occurring in the minds of the users.</p>
